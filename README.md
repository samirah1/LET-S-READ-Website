# LET'S READ Website

LET'S READ is an annual youth event facilitating a competitive and fun environment to learn about the teachings of Islam. It is organized by the Muslim Ummah of North America (MUNA), a non-profit religious organization. This event hosts multiple competitions for students in grades K-12 around the US, Canada, Australia, and Bangladesh. 

This website contains all the information that the competitors, judges, and competitors' families need to know for the competition. It includes a rulebook, competition details, resources for the students for each type of competition, rubrics and scoring guidelines for judges, and the registration form and FAQs for families. I built this site with a team of 2-3 using Wordpress, Elementor, and additional plugins offered in Wordpress. For example, I used Elementor to easily design and organize the webpages, Royal Elementor Addons to design a custom navigation menu and footer for the website, and Watu Quiz to create sample quizzes for the Quiz Competition for each grade level. The registration form is a Jotform embedded into the registration page in the website.
