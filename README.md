# LET'S READ Website

LET'S READ is an annual youth event facilitating a competitive and fun environment to learn about the teachings of Islam. It is organized by the Muslim Ummah of North America (MUNA), a non-profit religious organization. This event hosts multiple competitions for students in grades K-12 in the US, Canada, Australia, and Bangladesh. 

My role as a volunteer is to assist with the technology for planning, organizing, and hosting the competition. I built this website with a team of 2-3. This site contains all the information that the competitors, judges, and competitors' families need to know for the competition. It includes a rulebook, competition details, resources for the students for each type of competition, rubrics and scoring guidelines for judges, and the registration form and FAQs for families. We used Wordpress, Elementor, and additional plugins offered in Wordpress. For example, I used Elementor to easily design and organize the webpages, Royal Elementor Addons to design a custom navigation menu and footer for the website, and Watu Quiz to create sample quizzes for the Quiz Competition for each grade level. The registration form is a Jotform embedded into the registration page in the website.
